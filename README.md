# Project3GameRoom
This project was desinged for The Gaming Room team and their the software they want to develop is for a game called Draw It or Lose It. The videogame will be a web based game that will be widely available on multiple platforms such as iOS, Android, and Windows. 

The document submitted is a well communicated outline of the clients needs and requirements for the game. These are mostly just suggestions that the client can take into consideration for the development of the game itself. 

I thought the UML was a great outline of how the client wanted to build on the game. It was an effective tool to communicate the game design mechanics. 

I think I could have put more work into detailing the "Domain Model" table. It had some general information could have strengthened mine and the clients understanding of that section. 

Understanding the wants and needs of the user is part of being a goood programmer. After all they are the customer at the end of the day and it is always beneficial to have a product with a good quality of life. 

When desining the code for the game I wanted to make sure what the requirements were and know how to implement them. Understanding the template provided by the client and going by the UML is a great practice. It is best to understand what are the specifics of the clients requirement and going by the industry standards when developing code.
